# Bandmates

## Front-End Capstone: Mobile group application aiming to diffuse communication and scheduling issues between band members. Built with the Ionic framework using Firebase Realtime database.

## About

After playing music in Nashville, TN for several years, I noticed a trend in communication/scheduling discrepencies between bandmembers. Considering many musicians in the Nashville area play in multiple projects, I wanted to make an app that offered a single source of truth for band happenings. 

1. A user can create an account, and from there create a band account or join an existing band account. 

2. Once a user has successfully logged in and joined a band, he or she has access to (for each band) a real-time messenger to the rest of the band, a shared calendar, and an archive of past shows and setlists.

3. Anyone in the band group can create an event whether it as a practice or a show. On the users main page, a list of upcoming events populates the page. Here, a user can share the event as well as the location (powered by the Google Places API).



## Technologies

1. Ionic Framework (which uses the Angularjs framework)
2. Firebase Database (featuring real-time interaction and authentiaction)
